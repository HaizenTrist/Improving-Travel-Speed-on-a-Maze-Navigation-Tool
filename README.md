# Improving Travel Speed on a Maze Navigation Tool
Created a program to quickly navigate any maze and find the shortest path to a destination using Python and the A-Star Search algorithm, running at least 3 times faster than basic path search methods.

Further reduced search time by 20% by implementing intelligent path choice using a Priority Queue and the Manhattan Distance method.

A basic visualization of the algorithm's operation is provided below. The ability to edit start/goal/obstacle markers was added using the PyGame library.
