# A* Search Algorithm
Implementation of the A* path-search and traversal algorithm.

Finds the shortest possible travel route on a grid from a given start to a defined destination while navigating around obstacles.

Efficiently finds optimal paths, discarding less efficient routes and saving on execution time by using a Priority Queue and the Manhattan Distance heuristic.

A basic visualization of the algorithm's operation and the ability to edit start/goal/obstacle markers is provided using the PyGame library.
